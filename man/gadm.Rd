package and/or a specified path and/or a temporary path.
}
\details{
If the `path` and/or `intlib` arguments are `NULL`, it will be asked
interactively to the user to decide where to store the file. The function
will return a message if the file is already present in the internal library
or in the specify path. \cr\cr
The argument `path` can be input with 3 types: `NULL`, boolean (`FALSE`,
`TRUE`) or a character string and the argument `intlib` support 2 types:
`NULL`,boolean (`FALSE`, `TRUE`).
The graph will show you the interaction between these two arguments
to download sp or sf file format from GADM:
